# Scroll-Controlled Lockpick Animation Landing Page

**Live Demo**: https://red-team-lock-pickin-dtmd.bolt.host/

## The Problem
Red team and penetration testing firms have identical websites: generic "we secure your business" headlines, stock photos of locks, bullet-point service lists. Prospects can't differentiate between vendors, and technical value is lost in corporate speak.

## The Solution
Interactive scroll-controlled animation that visualizes the red team process:
- Lock appears closed (locked state = vulnerable system)
- User scrolls down = lockpicking happens in real-time
- Lock opens = "ACCESS GRANTED" reveal
- Message: "We Find The Vulnerabilities First"
- Converts passive viewing into active engagement

## Why This Works for Security Companies
1. **Visual storytelling**: Shows what you do instead of telling
2. **Immediate differentiation**: Stands out from generic competitors
3. **Engagement boost**: Visitors must interact to see full message
4. **Trust signal**: Sophisticated design = competent security team
5. **Memorable**: People remember experiences, not bullet points

## Use Cases
- **Red Team Operations**: Visualize attack simulation process
- **Penetration Testing Firms**: Show "we break in to help you secure"
- **Security Consultancies**: Demonstrate problem-solving approach
- **MDR/SOC Providers**: Adapt for threat detection narrative

## Tech Stack
- React + Canvas for frame-by-frame rendering
- Scroll event listener for frame control
- 150+ animation frames synced to scroll position
- Responsive design (desktop priority)

## Design Details
- **Color palette**: Red (threat) → Cyan (security) gradient
- **Lock visual**: Circuit board pattern (cyber theme)
- **Animation style**: Smooth 60fps, tied to scroll percentage
- **Final CTA**: "Schedule Red Team Assessment" after unlock
