# Voice AI Lead Qualifier for Cybersecurity Firms

## The Problem
Mid-market security companies lose qualified leads due to manual phone processes:
- Miss calls when prospects contact outside business hours (60% of B2B calls happen after 5pm)
- Waste 15+ minutes per call doing basic qualification (company size, security needs, budget)
- Prospects abandon interest during phone tag with busy sales teams
- No way to instantly book consultations without back-and-forth scheduling
- Junior sales reps struggle to qualify technical security requirements properly

## The Solution
VAPI-powered voice AI assistant that handles inbound calls 24/7:
- Answers calls in natural conversational voice (sounds human, not robotic)
- Qualifies prospects by understanding security needs (VAPT, SOC 2, MDR, cloud security)
- Books consultations directly into calendar without human touchpoints
- Handles rescheduling and cancellations autonomously
- Transfers complex questions to human experts when needed

## Use Cases
1. **MDR/SOC**: Qualify enterprise buyers asking about 24/7 threat monitoring
2. **GRC**: Screen compliance prospects (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA) and book gap assessments
3. **Offensive Security**: Understand pentest scope (web app, cloud, network) before booking calls
4. **All Segments**: Capture after-hours leads that would otherwise go to voicemail

## Tech Stack
- VAPI (Voice AI Platform)
- GPT-4o for conversation intelligence
- Deepgram Nova-3 transcription
- n8n for calendar integration (optional)
- Supabase for booking storage (optional)

## Target Audience
Mid-market cybersecurity companies ($1M-50M revenue):
- Security founders tired of missing calls
- Sales teams overwhelmed with unqualified inquiries
- Companies expanding globally (need multi-timezone coverage)
- Firms with high inbound call volume but limited sales staff

## Impact
- 100% lead capture rate (no missed calls, ever)
- 15min saved per inquiry (eliminates manual qualification)
- Instant booking without scheduling friction
- Works 24/7/365 without hiring night-shift teams
- Filters out unqualified prospects before human sales time
