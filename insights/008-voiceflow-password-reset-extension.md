# Voiceflow Security Assessment Form Extension

## The Problem
Mid-market security companies lose qualified prospects during form-filling friction:
- Prospects abandon multi-step website forms (average 68% abandonment rate)
- No conversational context - forms feel cold and transactional
- Manual follow-up required after form submission
- No instant qualification - sales teams waste time on unfit prospects
- Prospects prefer chat over filling out long forms

## The Solution
Voiceflow custom extension that renders assessment request form inside chat conversation:
- Natural conversation flow → form appears contextually when needed
- Embedded directly in chat interface (no page redirects)
- Auto-triggers n8n workflow to notify sales team + send confirmation email
- Captures qualified lead data (company, compliance needs, team size)
- Instant response confirmation inside chat

## Use Cases
1. **MDR/SOC**: Qualify enterprises seeking 24/7 threat monitoring before booking demos
2. **GRC**: Collect compliance requirements (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA) before gap assessments
3. **Cloud Security**: Understand cloud environment (AWS/Azure/GCP) before CSPM demos
4. **Offensive Security**: Capture pentest scope (web app, network, cloud) before calls

## Tech Stack
- Voiceflow (conversational AI platform)
- Custom HTML/CSS/JS form extension
- n8n webhook automation (triggers email + CRM updates)
- Notion/Airtable for lead database (optional)

## Target Audience
Mid-market cybersecurity companies ($1M-50M revenue):
- Security founders optimizing lead qualification
- Sales teams tired of unqualified discovery calls
- Marketing teams measuring form conversion rates
- Companies using Voiceflow for website chat

## Impact
- 40-60% higher form completion (conversational context reduces abandonment)
- Instant lead qualification (compliance needs, team size captured upfront)
- Zero manual follow-up (n8n auto-sends confirmation + notifies sales)
- Better lead data quality (chat context clarifies requirements)
- Faster sales cycle (pre-qualified prospects book faster)
