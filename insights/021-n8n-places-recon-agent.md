# N8N Places Recon Agent

An n8n AI agent embedded on a cybersecurity company website that queries 
Google Places API in real-time — giving founders and consultants instant 
location intelligence through a simple chat interface.

## The Problem

Cybersecurity consultants doing physical site assessments or pre-engagement 
recon waste 30–60 minutes per client manually researching locations, nearby 
vendors, and access context across multiple browser tabs.

**Result:** Unstructured notes, no audit trail, time burned before the 
engagement even starts.

## The Solution

Conversational AI agent embedded on your website that pulls live Places API 
data on demand — structured, fast, and auditable.

**Key Features:**
- Natural language → real-time location intelligence
- Embedded directly on your company site (no external tools)
- Pulls ratings, hours, reviews, and nearby businesses
- Keeps recon context in one place for engagement documentation

## Use Cases

- Pre-engagement physical recon for red team ops
- Client site intel before on-site GRC or compliance assessments  
- Third-party vendor location vetting
- Social engineering context gathering (authorized engagements only)

## Tech Stack

- n8n (AI Agent workflow)
- OpenAI GPT-4o (chat model)
- Google Places API (location intelligence)
- Bolt.new (frontend + embed)

## Target Audience

Security founders, red team operators, GRC consultants, and SOC managers 
at mid-market firms ($1M–50M) doing on-site client work.

## Impact

- Pre-engagement location research: 45 min → under 5 min
- Auditable recon output, not scattered browser tabs
- Zero extra tools — lives inside your existing company website
