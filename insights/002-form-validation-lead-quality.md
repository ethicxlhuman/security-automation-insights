# Form Validation for Lead Quality

**Prototype link**: https://cybersecurity-lead-q-kps4.bolt.host/

## The Problem
Security companies lose 30-40% of form submissions to invalid data. Sales teams waste 5-10 hours/week cleaning CRM entries, validating emails, and chasing prospects with incomplete information.

## The Solution
Form validation that explains errors before submission:
- Real-time input checking (email format, required fields)
- Helpful error messages ("Business email required" vs. "Invalid")
- Business email enforcement (rejects gmail/yahoo)
- Clean data stored in Supabase (no CRM pollution)

## Use Cases
1. **Lead Capture**: Filter out spam and competitor research submissions
2. **GRC Evidence Collection**: Validate compliance data completeness before acceptance
3. **Client Onboarding**: Ensure accurate company info from day one
4. **Demo Requests**: Qualify leads at point of capture, not after

## Tech Stack
- React form with client-side validation
- Supabase for validated data storage
- Email validation library
- Bolt.new for rapid prototyping
