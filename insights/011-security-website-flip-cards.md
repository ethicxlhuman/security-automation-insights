# Security Website Flip Cards

Prototype: https://location-aware-cyber-g2rb.bolt.host/

Interactive flip cards for cybersecurity company websites that reveal detailed service information on click, improving engagement without complex navigation.

## The Problem

Security company websites struggle with information presentation:
- Services pages have too much text (visitors bounce)
- Feature lists are boring and hard to scan
- Modal popups feel intrusive and break flow
- Multi-page navigation loses visitor attention
- Technical services need both "what" and "how" without overwhelming

**Result:** Prospects leave before understanding your value proposition.

## The Solution

Flip cards with smooth Y-axis rotation that show:
- **Front:** Service name, icon, brief value proposition
- **Back:** Key features, pricing indicator, CTA button

**Key Features:**
- Click to flip (intentional interaction, not accidental hover)
- 0.6s smooth Y-axis rotation animation
- Professional presentation for B2B cybersecurity audience
- Mobile-responsive (works on all devices)
- No JavaScript frameworks required

## Best Practices

**Do:**
- Keep front side concise (icon + title + 1-line value prop)
- Make back side actionable (features + clear CTA)
- Use consistent card sizes across the page
- Test on mobile devices (ensure tap works, not just hover)

**Don't:**
- Overload back side with walls of text
- Use auto-flip or hover (users need control)
- Mix card sizes randomly (looks unprofessional)
- Forget accessibility (add keyboard navigation)
