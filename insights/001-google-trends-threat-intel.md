**Prototype link**: https://threat-intelligence-624r.bolt.host

## The Problem
Security analysts spend 5-10 hours/week manually tracking:
- CVE vulnerability trends
- Ransomware campaign popularity
- Competitor security incidents
- Industry compliance deadlines

## The Solution
Automated Google Trends monitoring for threat intelligence:
- Track multiple security terms simultaneously
- Visual spike detection for emerging threats
- Compare threat popularity over time
- Export data for threat reports

## Use Cases
1. **CVE Monitoring**: Track which vulnerabilities are gaining attention
2. **Ransomware Tracking**: Monitor campaign popularity (LockBit, BlackCat, etc.)
3. **Incident Response**: See if your breach is trending publicly
4. **Content Strategy**: Identify hot security topics for timely blog posts

## Tech Stack
- Google Trends API (SerpAPI key)
- Chart.js for visualization
- Bolt.new for rapid prototyping
