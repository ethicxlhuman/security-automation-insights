# QR Code Generator for Security Reports

Simple Python microservice that generates scannable QR codes for embedding external references in pentest reports, compliance documentation, and client deliverables.

## The Problem

Security firms include 10-15+ external URLs in reports:
- CVE database references (cve.mitre.org, nvd.nist.gov)
- Remediation guides and vendor documentation
- Proof-of-concept videos on private servers
- Secure file sharing portals for sensitive findings
- OWASP/SANS reference materials

**Result:** Reports look cluttered with long URLs, clients mistype links, and PDFs feel unprofessional.

## The Solution

Local Python microservice that converts URLs to scannable QR codes:
- Input: Any URL (API endpoint, documentation, CVE reference)
- Output: Clean PNG file ready for report embedding
- Use Case: Drop QR code in PDF → Client scans → Direct access to resource

**Key Features:**
- Runs locally (no external API dependencies)
- Instant generation (< 1 second)
- Standard PNG output (embeds in Word/PDF)
- Clean presentation for B2B clients

## Use Cases

**Offensive Security:**
- Link to detailed exploitation POCs without cluttering executive summary
- Reference multiple CVEs without breaking page flow
- Direct clients to secure remediation guides

**GRC Firms:**
- Compliance documentation with regulation references
- Evidence collection portals for auditors
- Policy document version control links

**All Segments:**
- Event booth materials (link to case studies)
- Business cards (portfolio/demo links)
- Physical security handbooks with digital resources

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- `qrcode` library (pip install qrcode[pil])
- FastAPI (lightweight local service)
- PIL/Pillow (image processing)

## Target Audience

- Offensive security firms generating 20+ pentest reports monthly
- GRC consultants creating compliance documentation
- Security companies with client-facing deliverables

## Impact

**Before:** 3-page pentest report with 12 long URLs breaking across lines  
**After:** Clean 2-page report with embedded QR codes for optional deep-dives

**Efficiency:** 30 seconds per URL → 5 seconds automated generation  
**Client Experience:** Professional presentation, zero typo errors, mobile-friendly access
