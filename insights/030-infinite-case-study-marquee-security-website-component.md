# Infinite Case Study Marquee — Security Website Component

Prototype: https://ai-website-cybersecurity-company.vercel.app/

An infinite auto-scrolling marquee built with Magic UI's Marquee component,
displaying cybersecurity case studies with real client outcomes. Loops forever,
pauses on hover, and requires zero manual interaction.

## The Problem

Security company websites bury their best proof:
- Case studies hidden behind paginated buttons
- Prospects leave before clicking "See More"
- Social proof doesn't move — so neither does the eye

**Result:** Your wins stay invisible to buyers who don't scroll.

## The Solution

A horizontal infinite marquee on the Case Studies page that:
- Auto-scrolls through client engagements (Healthcare, Finance, Gov, etc.)
- Displays industry tag, key metric, and outcome per card
- Pauses when a prospect hovers to read details
- Loops forever with no manual input
