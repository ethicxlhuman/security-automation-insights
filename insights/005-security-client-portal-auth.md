# Security Client Portal Authentication

## The Problem
Mid-market security firms waste time on client portal access:
- Manual account creation for every client (10-15min each)
- Email verification done manually or skipped entirely
- No audit trail for compliance requirements (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Unprofessional UX damages trust with enterprise buyers

## The Solution
Supabase-powered authentication for cybersecurity client portals:
- Self-service user registration
- Automated email verification (compliance audit trail)
- Secure session management
- Professional login interface

## Use Cases
1. **MDR/SOC**: Client access to security alerts, incident reports, threat intelligence
2. **GRC**: Compliance dashboard for evidence review, audit logs, policy docs
3. **Cloud Security**: CSPM client portals for posture scores, misconfiguration alerts
4. **Offensive Security**: Pentest report access, vulnerability findings, remediation tracking

## Tech Stack
- Supabase Authentication
- Email verification automation
- Session-based auth with redirect
- PostgreSQL user management

## Target Audience
Mid-market cybersecurity companies ($1M-50M revenue):
- MDR/SOC providers
- GRC consulting firms
- Cloud security companies
- Offensive security teams

## Impact
- Eliminates 10-15 minutes per client onboarding
