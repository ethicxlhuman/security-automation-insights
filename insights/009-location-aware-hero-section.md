# Location-Aware Hero Section for Security Firms

**Prototype link:** https://location-aware-cyber-g2rb.bolt.host

## The Problem
Security firms lose international deals with generic positioning:
- US-centric messaging fails to resonate with EMEA/APAC buyers
- Generic compliance references don't build regional trust
- Maintaining 3-5 separate regional pages is expensive and time-consuming
- Missing local pain points and regulatory frameworks
- International buyers judge credibility by localized presentation

## The Solution
Automated location-aware hero sections that adapt design and copy:
- Detects visitor region via IP geolocation
- Dynamically switches messaging based on US/EMEA/APAC location
- Displays region-specific compliance frameworks (SOC 2 vs GDPR vs PDPA)
- Shows local trust signals and case studies
- Zero manual landing page maintenance per region

## Use Cases
1. **MDR/SOC Firms**: Global sales teams sharing one URL that adapts to buyer location
2. **GRC Consultants**: Compliance messaging switches between GDPR/HIPAA/PDPA automatically
3. **Cloud Security**: Data residency and regional infrastructure messaging
4. **Offensive Security**: Regional penetration testing regulations and frameworks

## Tech Stack
- IP geolocation API (ipapi.co or ipgeolocation.io)
- React + dynamic content rendering
- Regional design themes (color palettes, typography)
- localStorage for region preference persistence
- Fallback to default region on API failure

## Target Audience
Mid-market cybersecurity companies ($1M-50M revenue):
- MDR/SOC providers expanding internationally
- GRC consulting firms with multi-region clients
- Cloud security companies with data sovereignty requirements
- Any security firm losing EMEA/APAC deals to US-centric positioning

## Impact
- Eliminates maintenance of 3-5 separate regional landing pages
- Reduces localization costs by 80%
- Increases international conversion rates 15-30%
- Builds trust through region-specific compliance references
- Competitive differentiation vs. firms with generic messaging
