# HackerNews Jobs Scraper

Python + Playwright script that scrapes job listings from HackerNews and exports them to CSV - job title, post age, comment count, and direct URL.

## The Problem

Security founders and hiring managers manually browse HackerNews job boards to track what roles competitors are hiring for, what skills are in demand, and which companies are scaling their security teams. This is done by hand with no structured output and no repeatable process.

## The Solution

A Playwright script that opens the HN jobs board, extracts all listings, and exports a clean CSV - giving security firms a repeatable snapshot of the talent market without any manual effort.

## Use Cases

1. **Talent Intelligence** - MDR/SOC firms tracking which security roles competitors are actively hiring for
2. **Skill Gap Analysis** - GRC consultants identifying which compliance frameworks are in highest demand
3. **Prospect Research** - Offensive security teams spotting companies scaling their security headcount (warm leads)
4. **Market Signals** - Security founders using hiring velocity as an indicator of company growth before outreach

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Playwright (headless Chromium)
- CSV export (stdlib)

## Target Audience

Mid-market cybersecurity firms ($1M–$50M revenue) that need structured talent market intelligence to inform hiring strategy, competitive positioning, or outbound sales - without paying for LinkedIn Recruiter or analyst reports.

## Impact

- Manual HN browsing → automated CSV export in under 60 seconds
- Unstructured job scanning → structured data ready for filtering or CRM import
- One-time check → schedulable weekly intelligence snapshot
