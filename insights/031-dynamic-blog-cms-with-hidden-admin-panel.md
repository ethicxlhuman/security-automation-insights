# Dynamic Blog CMS with Hidden Admin Panel

## The Problem

Security company websites have static blogs. Publishing a new post means editing code, pushing to GitHub, and redeploying - a process that kills content velocity and requires developer involvement every time.

## The Solution

A Supabase-powered blog where posts are fetched dynamically, paired with a hidden `/admin-panel` route for creating and editing content — no redeployment, no code changes, ever.

**Key Features:**
- Hidden admin panel accessible only via direct slug (`/admin-panel`)
- Create, edit, and publish posts through a rich text editor
- Posts go live instantly on the blog page
- Wallpaper/thumbnail upload support per post
- URL slug auto-generation

## Use Cases

- MDR providers publishing weekly threat intel without developer help
- GRC consultants updating compliance guidance as regulations change
- Security founders managing thought leadership content independently

## Impact

- Eliminates developer dependency for content updates
- Reduces time-to-publish from hours (redeploy cycle) to seconds
- Enables consistent content output — a key trust signal for cybersecurity buyers
