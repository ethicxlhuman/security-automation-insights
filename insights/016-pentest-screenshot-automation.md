# Pentest Screenshot Automation API

**Prototype:** FastAPI + Pillow + OpenCV for automated screenshot cropping and captioning

Automate the tedious screenshot preparation process that consumes 2-3 hours per pentest report—crop, caption, and format evidence images via API calls from n8n workflows.

## The Problem

Offensive security teams waste massive time on report screenshots:
- **100+ screenshots** taken per pentest (vulnerabilities, exploits, PoCs)
- **Manual cropping** to highlight relevant areas (2+ hours per report)
- **Inconsistent captions** across evidence images
- **Formatting overhead** for professional client deliverables
- **Copy-paste hell** inserting images into report templates

**Reality:** Pentest firms report spending 70-85% of project time on reporting, with screenshot preparation being a major bottleneck.

## The Solution

FastAPI-based image processing service that:
- **Accepts image URLs** (screenshots hosted on postimg.org, imgbb, etc.)
- **Auto-centers and crops** images to relevant content areas
- **Overlays 3-word captions** (bottom-center) describing vulnerability/finding
- **Requires API key** for secure access from n8n workflows
- **Returns processed images** ready for report insertion

**Workflow Integration:**
1. Pentester takes screenshots during testing → uploads to image host
2. n8n captures screenshot URLs + finding descriptions
3. API processes: download → crop → caption → return
4. Auto-insert into report template (Dradis, PlexTrac, custom)

## Use Cases

**Web Application Pentesting:**
- XSS proof-of-concept screenshots with "XSS Payload Executed" caption
- SQL injection results with "Database Enumeration Success" caption
- Authentication bypass evidence with "Admin Access Gained" caption

**Network Pentesting:**
- Nmap scan results with "Open Ports Identified" caption
- Metasploit exploit screenshots with "Remote Code Execution" caption
- Credential harvesting with "Plaintext Passwords Captured" caption

**Cloud Security Assessments:**
- Misconfigured S3 buckets with "Public Data Exposure" caption
- IAM privilege escalation with "Admin Privileges Escalated" caption
- Exposed API keys with "Credentials Leaked Publicly" caption

## Impact

**Time Savings:**
- **Manual process:** 2-3 hours per report for screenshot prep
- **Automated process:** 5 minutes for 100+ screenshots
- **ROI:** 95% time reduction on evidence formatting

**Quality Improvements:**
- Consistent caption formatting across all evidence        
- Professional presentation for client deliverables
- Reduced human error in image labeling

**Business Value:**
- Pentest firms save 70-85% of reporting time (industry data)
- Faster report delivery = more projects per quarter
- Junior pentesters can focus on testing vs. formatting
