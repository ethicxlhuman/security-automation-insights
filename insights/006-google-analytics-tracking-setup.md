# Google Analytics Tracking for Security Firms

## The Problem
Mid-market security companies waste marketing budget on content that doesn't convert:
- No visibility into which pages CISOs visit before booking calls
- Can't identify high-intent prospects (e.g., visitors reading compliance pages 3+ times)
- Marketing teams guess which content resonates vs. using data
- No ROI proof for content investments (whitepapers, case studies, trust pages)

## The Solution
Google Analytics integration for cybersecurity company websites:
- Automatic visitor behavior tracking
- Page engagement metrics (time on compliance pages, case studies, pricing)
- Conversion path analysis (which content sequence leads to booked calls)
- High-intent prospect identification

## Use Cases
1. **MDR/SOC**: Track which threat intelligence content attracts enterprise buyers vs. SMBs
2. **GRC**: Identify prospects reading SOC 2/ISO 27001 pages repeatedly (compliance buyers)
3. **Cloud Security**: Monitor which CSPM use cases drive the most demo requests
4. **Offensive Security**: See if prospects read methodology pages before booking pentests

## Tech Stack
- Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
- gtag.js tracking script
- Automatic page view tracking
- Event tracking (button clicks, form submissions)

## Target Audience
Mid-market cybersecurity companies ($1M-50M revenue):
- Security founders optimizing lead gen
- Marketing teams proving content ROI
- Sales teams identifying high-intent prospects
- Any security firm with active website content strategy

## Impact
- Eliminates guesswork in content strategy
- Identifies which pages convert enterprise buyers (e.g., compliance pages = high-intent)
- Proves marketing ROI by connecting content to booked calls
- Optimizes website trust signals based on actual buyer behavior
- Reduces wasted spend on low-performing content

## Setup Instructions
1. Create Google Analytics 4 account at https://analytics.google.com
2. Get your tracking code (G-XXXXXXXXXX)
3. Add gtag.js script to your website's <head> section
4. Verify data collection in GA4 dashboard (24-48hrs for first data)
