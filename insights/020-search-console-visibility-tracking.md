# Search Console Visibility Tracking

Track whether prospects find your security company when searching for services like "MDR provider Austin" or "SOC 2 consultant."

## The Problem

Security companies lose deals because:
- They don't rank for local service searches
- Technical SEO errors block indexing
- Competitors outrank them for key terms
- No visibility into what prospects actually search

**Result:** Website gets traffic but not from buyers searching for your exact services.

## The Solution

Google Search Console shows:
- Which searches show your site
- Your ranking position (page 1 vs page 10)
- Click-through rates per query
- Technical errors blocking indexing

## Use Cases

**MDR/SOC providers:** Track "managed detection response [city]"
**GRC consultants:** Monitor "SOC 2 compliance consultant"
**Pentest firms:** Check "penetration testing services"

## Tech Stack

- Google Search Console (free)
- Domain verification (DNS or HTML file)

## Target Audience

Security company founders who need local/service-based visibility.

## Impact

- See exactly which searches need SEO work
- Fix technical errors killing rankings
- Prioritize content for high-value keywords
- Track competitor movements
